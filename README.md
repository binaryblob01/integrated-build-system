IBS - Integrated Build system for the LibraNix operating system.


IBS is the LibraNext Integrated Build System. It's primary purpose is to enable easier building of the LibraNix operating system and ensuring all team members are using the same options.

The main idea behind IBS is a newt-based CLI GUI that allows users to more easily compile the LibraNix OS from scratch. It requires less knowledge to compile using IBS than it does otherwise. IBS ensures that there is uniformity across builds which means easier debugging.

IBS is designed to live on an ISO and then build a LibraNix system using a hard drive. IBS distributions may include source code on the ISO already or may require it to be downloaded.

The built system will then be installed and configured on the hard drive.
